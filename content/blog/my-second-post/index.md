Welcome to my second ever blog post, I don't know how many more of these I will make.

Want to talk a little about Re:zero? Well I do, I'd love to tell you about it!
I found Re:zero back when its first season aired in 2016. Re:zero has been one of my favorite shows ever since I first watched it
my expereience watching Re:zero for the first time was something completely unforgettable and I still love to watch it over and over again today.
I'm so excited that a new season is finally coming out it always feels like so long since the last one came out. I mean it's been four years.
So far the current season has had some crazy high stakes its been keeping me on the edge of my seat every single episode. Waiting for a new episode every week is so hard.
